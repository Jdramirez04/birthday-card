          <p>   I am very Eager to apply for the Trimble software engineering internship program. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering, and ever since I was a kid I’ve loved tinkering with computers and a few years ago was able to save up enough money to build my own. The more and more I delved into designing the best computer and figuring out how all these parts come together made me realize that I wanted to continue doing it for my professional career.</p>

In high school, I joined the robotics club. Where I learned a ton about programming and electronics although I was mostly shadowing others I learned a lot either way. I was able to start tinkering with arduinos at home on my own and made pretty simple things like a sunlight dependent lightbulb. But although it was simple to me it was just the beginning of the things I could do in this world. 
In college, I have been working on apps using Flutter whose programming language is Dart. This has given me lots of experience in creating cross-platform apps for both IOS and Android. While I was building these apps It just made me realize how strong my desire to be a software Engineer is.
